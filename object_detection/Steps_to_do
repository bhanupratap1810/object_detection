Step 1: Create an Anaconda environment with python version 3.6.
conda create -n retinanet python=3.6 anaconda

Step 2: Activate the environment and install the necessary packages.
conda activate retinanet
conda install tensorflow numpy scipy opencv pillow matplotlib h5py keras

Step 3: Then install the ImageAI library.
pip install https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/2.0.1/imageai-2.0.1-py3-none-any.whl

Step 4: Now download the pretrained model required to generate predictions. This model is based on RetinaNet (a subject of a future article). Click on the link to download: https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5

Step 5: Copy the downloaded file to your current working folder

Step 6: Download the image from the repository. Name the image as image.jpg

Step 7: Open jupyter notebook (type "jupyter notebook" in your terminal) and run the following codes:

from imageai.Detection import ObjectDetection
import os
execution_path = os.getcwd()
detector = ObjectDetection()
detector.setModelTypeAsRetinaNet()
detector.setModelPath( os.path.join(execution_path , "resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5"))
detector.loadModel()
detections = detector.detectObjectsFromImage(input_image=os.path.join(execution_path , "image.jpg"), output_image_path=os.path.join(execution_path , "image_new.jpg"))
for eachObject in detections:
   print(eachObject["name"] + " : " + eachObject["percentage_probability"] )
   print("--------------------------------")

This will create a modified image file named image_new.jpg, which contains the bounding box for your image.

Step 8: To print the image use the following code:

from IPython.display import Image
Image("image_new.jpg")
